    New features:
       * Optimized cave map generator (Thanks to James Neal)
       * Optimized DijkstraShortestPath.FindPath method (Thanks to flend for this update)
       * Multiple new "Try" methods which return null instead of throwing exceptions
       * Diagonal paths can be found by using new constructors on GoalMap and PathFinder
       * Map.GetCellsInCircle and Map.GetBorderCellsInCircle to get cells within a circular radius
    Breaking changes:
       * Point and Rectangle classes are now structs (Thanks to James Neal)
       * Updated all appropriate references to Cell with ICell (Thanks to Courtney Strachan)
       * Map.ComputeFov and Map.AppendFov both return a ReadonlyCollection of ICell instead void
       * The Path returned from PathFinder.ShortestPath now includes the source cell in the returned Path 
       * Map.GetCellsInArea was renamed to Map.GetCellsInSquare
       * Map.GetCellsInRadius was renamed to Map.GetCellsInDiamond
